				 match  case  statement.
		==================================================
=>Here "match  case" is one the new feature in Python 3.10 Version onwards
=>match  case  statement is recommeded to take in deciding Pre-designed Conditions in 
   Menu Driven Applications.
-------------------
=>Syntax:
-------------------
			match(Choice Expr):
			       case Choice Label1:
					Block of Stements-1
			       case Choice Label2:
					Block of Stements-2
			       case Choice Label3:
					Block of Stements-3
			       ----------------------------
			       case Choice Label-n:
					Block of Stements-n
			       case _:					 # Default Case Block
					default Block of Statements
			
			-------------------------------------------------------
			Other Statements in Program
			-------------------------------------------------------

Explanation:
----------------------
=>Here "match" and "case" are the keywords
=>"Choice Expr" represents either int or str  or bool
=>If "Choice Expr" is matching with "case label1" then PVM executes Block of Staements-1 and later executes Other statements in program.
=>If "Choice Expr" is matching with "case label2" then PVM executes Block of Staements-2 and later executes Other statements in program.
=>In General "Choice Expr" is trying match with case label-1, case label-2,....case label-n then PVM executes corresponding block of statements and later executes Other statements in program.
=>If "Choice Expr" is not matching with  any  of the specified case labels then PVM executes Default Block of Statements which are written under default case block (case _ ) and later executes Other statements in program.
=>Writing default case block is optional and If we write then it must be written at last (Otherwise we get SyntaxError)
=>When we represent multiple case labels under one case then those case labels must be combined with Bitwise OR Operator ( | )  .
