					File Opening Modes in Python
		========================================
=>The purpose of File Opening Modes is that To specify which mode we are opening the file.
=>In Python , we have 8 file Opening Modes. They are
		1. r			
		2. w
		3. a
		4. r+
		5. w+
		6. a+
		7. x
		8. x+
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. r
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>This mode is used for Opening the File Read Mode
=>'r' is the default file mode 
=>When the file name in "r" mode and if that file name does not exist then we get FileNotFoundError.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. w
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>This Mode is used for Creating a New File and Open it in write mode always.
=>When Open NEW FILE in "w" Mode then it will be created and opened in Write Mode
=>When Open EXISTING FILE in "w" Mode then it will be opened in Write Mode and Existing Data 
     OVERLAPPED with new data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. a
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>When Open NEW FILE in "a" Mode then it will be created newly and opened in Write Mode
=>When Open EXISTING FILE in "a" Mode then it will be opened in Write Mode and Existing Data 
     APPENDED with new data.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. r+
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>This mode is used for Opening the File Read Mode
=>When the file name in "r+" mode  thhen the file name opened in read read mode and we  can First Read 
     the data and later additionally  we can perform write Operation also.
=>When we open the file in "r+" and if that file name does not exist then we get FileNotFoundError.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. w+
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>This Mode is used for Creating a New File and Open it in write mode always.
=>When Open NEW FILE in "w+" Mode then it will be created and opened in Write Mode
=>When Open EXISTING FILE in "w+" Mode then it will be opened in Write Mode and Existing Data 
     OVERLAPPED with new data
=>Additionally, with this mode First we can perform Write Operation and later we can perform Read 
     Operation and There is possibility of getting IOError, OSError  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. a+
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>When Open NEW FILE in "a+" Mode then it will be created newly and opened in Write Mode
=>When Open EXISTING FILE in "a+" Mode then it will be opened in Write Mode and Existing Data 
     APPENDED with new data.
=>Additionally, with this mode First we can perform Write Operation with appending ,and later we can 
    perform Read  Operation and There is possibility of getting IOError, OSError  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. x
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>This mode is used for opening the NEW FILE NAME eXclusively in Write Mode and we can perform write 
     Operations.
=>If we open EXISTING FILE in 'x' mode then we get FileExistError.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. x+
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>This mode is used for opening the NEW FILE NAME eXclusively in Write Mode and First we can perform 
     write  Operation and later additionally we can also perform Read Operation.
=>If we open EXISTING FILE in 'x+' mode then we get FileExistError.
