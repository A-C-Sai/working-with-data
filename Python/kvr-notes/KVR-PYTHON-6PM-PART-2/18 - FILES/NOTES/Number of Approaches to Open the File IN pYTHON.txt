				Number of Approaches to Open the File IN pYTHON
		========================================
=>In python programming, we have Two approaches to Open the files. They are
			
			1. By using open()

			2. By using  "with open() as "
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. By using open()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>Syntax:      varname=open("File Name","File Mode")
=>"varname" represents File Pointer  which is pointing to the file and it is one of the object and whose type 
     is <class, '_io.TextIOWrapper">
=>open() is a pre-defined function used for opening the Specified  File Name in Specified  File Mode.
=>"File Name" represents Name of the file
=>"File Mode" represnts r,w,a,r+,w+,a+,x,x+ 
=>Once we open the file name  by using open() , It recommended to close the file explicitly by using close(). There is no pissibility auto-closeability property with open()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. By using  "with open() as "
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>Syntax:     with  open("File Name","File Mode") as <varname>:
				-------------------------------------------------------
				-------------------------------------------------------

Explanation
-------------------
=>  here "with" 'as" are keywords
=>open() is a pre-defined function used for opening the Specified  File Name in Specified  File Mode.
=>"File Name" represents Name of the file
=>"File Mode" represnts r,w,a,r+,w+,a+,x,x+ 
=>"varname" represents File Pointer  which is pointing to the file and it is one of the object and whose type is <class, '_io.TextIOWrapper">
=>Once we open the file name  by using "with open() as " , It is not necessary to close file explicitly. By default when PVM Comes out of "with open() as " indemtation Block, PVM closes the file atomatically and this property is called "auto-closeability of file".
