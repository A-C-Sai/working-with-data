					File Opening Modes
		=================================================
=>The purpose of File Opening Modes in Python is that "In Which mode we are opening the files to perform Varaious Operations on Files."
=>In Python Programming, we have 8 File Opening Modes. They are
		1. r
		2. w
		3. a
		4. r+
		5. w+
		6. a+
		7. x
		8. x+
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. r 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>This Mode is used for Opening the File in Read Mode and we can perform Read    
    Operations only and we can' perform Write Operations.
=>When we open the file name in read mode and if the file name does not does not exist in 
    Secondary Memory then we get FileNotFoundError.
=>If we don't specify any File Opening Mode then by default PVM takes "r" mode as default 
    file mode.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. w 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>This Mode is used for creating New File and Opening that File Name in write Mode and 
    we can Perform Write Operations only and we can't perform Read Operations.
=>If we Open a NEW File Name in "w" Mode then It will be Opened newly in write mode and we can write the data from the begining of the file.
=>If we Open an EXISTING File Name in "w" Mode then It will be Opened in write mode and 
    Existing Data OVERLAPPED with new data.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. a 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>This Mode is used for creating New File and Opening that File Name in write Mode and 
    we can Perform Write Operations only and we can't perform Read Operations.
=>If we Open a NEW File Name in "a" Mode then It will be Opened newly in write mode and 
    we can write the data from the begining of the file.
=>If we Open an EXISTING File Name in "a" Mode then It will be Opened in write mode and 
    Existing Data  APPENDED with new data.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. r+ 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>This Mode is used for Opening the File in Read Mode and we can perform Read    
    Operations First and later we can perform Write Operations also.
=>When we open the file name in "r+" mode and if the file name does not does not exist in 
    Secondary Memory then we get FileNotFoundError.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. w+ 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>This Mode is used for creating New File and Opening that File Name in write Mode and 
    First we can Perform Write Operations and later we can perform Read Operations also.
=>If we Open a NEW File Name in "w+" Mode then It will be Opened newly in write mode 
    and we can write the data from the begining of the file.
=>If we Open an EXISTING File Name in "w+" Mode then It will be Opened in write mode 
    and  Existing Data OVERLAPPED with new data.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. a+ 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>This Mode is used for creating New File and Opening that File Name in write Mode and 
    First we can Perform Write Operations  and later we can perform Read Operations also.
=>If we Open a NEW File Name in "a+" Mode then It will be Opened newly in write mode 
   and   we can write the data from the begining of the file.
=>If we Open an EXISTING File Name in "a+" Mode then It will be Opened in write mode 
    and   Existing Data  APPENDED with new data.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. x          
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>This Mode is used for Opening the file name eXclusively in WRITE Mode only and we 
    can perform Write Operations only but not possibile perform read Operations.
=>If we Open Existing File  Name in "x" mode then we get FileExistError.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. x+          
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>This Mode is used for Opening the file name eXclusively in WRITE Mode only and we 
    can perform First Write Operations and  later we can perform read Operations also.
=>If we Open Existing File  Name in "x+" mode then we get FileExistError.
