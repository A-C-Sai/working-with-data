		====================================
			Building points in Exception Handling
		====================================
1. When the application user enters Invalid or Wrong Inputs then we get Runtime Errors.
		(Invalid Input-------->Runtime Error)
2. Runtime Errors by default generates Technical Error Messages.

3. Def. of Exception:: Runtime Errors of any Program are called exceptions
			( Invalid Input----->Runtime Error----->Exception)

4. Every Exception generates Technical Error Messages.

5. Def of Exceptions Handling:: The Process of Converting Technical Error Messages into 
						     User-Freindly Error Messages is called Exception handling


6. When an exception occurs  in Python program then we 3 things internally. They are

		a) Program Execution Terminated Abnormally by PVM
		b) PVM Comes out of Program flow 
		c) By Default PVM display Technical Error Messages.

7. To perform Step-(a)(b) and (c), Internally PVM creates an " object of appropriate exception     classes"

8. Hence If any exception occurs in Python program then PVM creates an object of appropriate exception     classes.
9. Hence Every Exception is considered as object of Exception class
     (Invalid Input----->Exception--->creates an object of Exception class)
